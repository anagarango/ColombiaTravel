        <p>
            Colombia is a country with a rich and diverse cultural heritage (also with gold and emeralds). Its culture and traditions are influenced by the indigenous peoples, Spanish colonization, African heritage, and the blending of different ethnic groups over the centuries. This incredible mix of cultures is evident in the country’s heritage, food, and music.

            The countries' and neighbouring countries biggest treasured values is family. Family is everything, to have respect among each other and loyalty, in fact its so regarded that extended families tend to live in the same city for family gatherings to see each other in a regular basis, meaning having lots and lots of conversations and delicious food and sharing "chisme".  
        </p>
        <p>
            Colombian's are in general very transparent, hospitable, and extroverted people. When you make eye contact with people passing by, its rude not to say hi. Because of this outgoing attitude, you can always see different neighbourhoods having their own dancing events in local shops. Especially on big cities like Bogota and Medellin, nightlife is very alive so its common to have people laughing and singing in the late night, no matter what the occasion is.

            Expect to see different kinds of food around Colombia. Each region in Colombia has their own twists of the same food or have unique special dishes served in their region, meaning you can find different meals in a matter of minutes when travelling to different regions. Although there are many varities of dishes, I'll be naming the ones most common ones that can be found in most places around Colombia that are my personal favourites.

            Firstly, empanadas are the number one reason why I want to visit Colombia for (besides family in Bogota of course). Although empanadas is a recipe shared around all Latin America and have their own versions of it, Colombias simplicity of just very very few ingredients is what makes it UNBELIEVABLE. Every local shop or street vendor you find on each corner has their own variations to it, sauces, you name it, and thats the best part! There are so many empanadas you can try that have their own little twist to it. Different fillings like beef, chicken, fish, potatoes, cheese, mushrooms, sometimes all in one, than you can add lemon juice, aji, or guacamole as a side . I havent salivated this much in a long time as I'm describing these empanadas, they are really a treasure to Colombia's cuisine.

            In dense Colombia cities, most animals you use is common birds like pigeons, and many street dogs and cats, and its somewhat rare to find wild animals roaming around the streets. But within deep forests and unbothered nature, many different spectacular weird animals can be found.

            Although not naturally found in Colombia, hippopotamuses were brought in by Pablo Escobar which has caused concerns about the <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/2021/01/11/invasive-hippos-escobar-colombia-castrate/">uncontrolled population of these hippos</a>. Because of the attention around this concern of what to do with the hippos, people have been curious to see this animals in "the wild" and has become sort of a tourist attraction in Escobar's old estate.
